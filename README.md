# blog.jameshawkins.dev

My personal blog, written in Vuepress. This was originally using Jekyll with the Accent theme, but I decided to recode it using Vuepress to match the rest of my site.

It deploys via GitHub Actions, using a Vuepress action available online, and is then published to [the interwebs](https://blog.jameshawkins.dev) with GitHub Pages.
