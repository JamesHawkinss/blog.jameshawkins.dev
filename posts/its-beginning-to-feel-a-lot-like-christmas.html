We had the cast party on the 12th December, where we watched the High School Musical film, ate pizza and had a great time. It was lovely to hang out with everyone again, and it felt like a really great way to end off that journey.</p> <p>The same day as the cast party, the Indigo Christmas Dinner took place. It was so much fun! Full of great food, laughs, and music. We participated in a secret santa, and I got the most amazing present; a picture frame full of pictures from High School Musical! Thanks Lizzie ðŸ˜ƒ</p> <p>On the 3rd, we were invited to the press release of the pantomime in Cambridge. Me, Mum and Catherine had a great time getting into the Christmas spirit.</p> <p>School broke up yesterday, and I'm really looking forward to two weeks of relaxation... and homework. Since we're on our GCSE courses now, I've been set more holiday homework than I was expecting - at least that'll give me some motivation to actually do something this holiday!</p> <p>Today I met some of my internet friends in Cambridge for the first time. Will drove down from Lincoln and picked up Tay from Luton, so massive shout-out for your 3 hour journey! We had an amazing time together; we went bowling, and then grabbed some lunch from the infamous Indigo. Here's a beautiful photo of me trying out some epic sunglasses in John Lewis:</p> <p><img src="/images/uploads/79480893_679774782553480_5637510777338551681_n.jpg" alt="Epic sunglasses!" title="Sunglasses :D"></p> <p>They're worth Â£199, but they've got directional Bluetooth speakers, meaning that you can listen to music and nobody else would know! I really wanna buy them... ( watch this space ;D )</p> <p>Thanks to Will, Tay and Rihan for meeting up in Cambridge for the first Cascaders Tour, may there be many more!</p> <p>My plans for the Christmas break are mainly just to relax and have a nice time with family and friends. On Christmas Eve I'll be going on a double date with some amazing people which I'm super pumped for. I'll also be going to Gloucester for a few days after Christmas, which will be lovely.</p> <p>Until later, y'all ðŸ˜„</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
