I actually have stuff to talk about this time, which is absolutely great.</p> <p>Yesterday evening, I purchased a notebook from Amazon, upon a recommendation from one of my friends. It's a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0095FFUM4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leuchtturm1917 notebook<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>, and it's very nice. When I was telling Mum about my purchase, she mentioned the <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bullet Journal<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> - and I had a bit of a Google to find out more.</p> <p>I'll be honest; when I was first reading about it, I thought it was all a little bit stupid and over-the-top just for taking notes. Despite this, I kept reading and started to think that maybe it wasn't such a bad idea after all. It's a clean way to organise tasks, notes and events (both past and future). The friend who suggested this notebook to me was telling me about how the specification for a Bullet Journal listed on their website is more of a framework and allows for users to build upon it in their own ways, taking features that they might consider helpful.</p> <p>I've decided that I'm going to try stick to using this format, and it should (if effective) help me to remember all the little things that I need to do - including post to this blog! You never know, I might actually be able to pass this DofE thing!</p> <p>What else happened today? I visited my grandparents for a few hours, and organised to buy a new laptop for Grandad (his is 7 years old and kinda slow) and so I'll be searching for a good laptop this evening. We had a nice chat about random stuff, and tried to figure out how to activate Grandma's Bank of Ireland card.</p> <p>I also got around to emptying all the junk out of a set of drawers in my room, and now there's junk all over my room instead!</p> <p>That's about all for now. See yas!</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
