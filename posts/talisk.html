You know why?</p> <p>I'll be going to two Talisk gigs in London and Cambridge respectively. Talisk are my favourite band, and I've seen them so many times I'm struggling to count!</p> <p>They started off their UK tour a few days ago and they're travelling all through the country this month. They posted on their Instagram (@taliskmusic) a few days ago about their new merchandise, and I can't wait to buy all of it! They've got new t-shirts, a jumper, and lots of stickers.</p> <p>When I go to see them in London I'm going with Dad, and when I go to see them in Cambridge I'm taking Holly.</p> <p>Expect a detailed review of each concert, and lots of photos!</p> <h3 id="in-other-news"><a href="#in-other-news" class="header-anchor">#</a> In other news...</h3> <p>So, I'm in Year 10 which means that I'm a GCSE student. Honestly, not the best experience of my life. All the teachers expect you to know stuff and actually have a clue about the subjects you chose - mad right?!?</p> <p>I think my favourite subject at the moment is Drama, it's the only lesson I look forward to having and it's pretty fun! We're doing lots of theory work at the moment, but apparently a lot of the GCSE is on the theory so it's probably a good idea that we get it out of the way now. We just finished a unit of work on A Dolls House by Henrik Ibsen, and part of that unit was having to watch the film in our own time. I can safely say that it's one of the most awful and boring plays I've ever looked at, and I hope that I never have to deal with it ever again!</p> <p>I'm sad to say that my least favourite subject is Computer Science. I really dislike the teacher and although he allows me to drink coffee in lesson, that's really the only good thing about him. I often wonder if he ever actually qualified to teach in the first place!</p> <p>peace xo</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
