So far, it's going pretty well - I'm already on pg. 3! I'm mainly using it to keep track of all the things I need to do, but it's also proving pretty helpful for noting down somewhat significant events that happen daily.</p> <p>Not too much has happened since the 16th, however a few things are worth writing about.</p> <p>On the 19th it was mine and Holly's 14 month anniversary, which is pretty snazzy. According to my notebook I also managed to do the washing up on that day, which must have been a huge accomplishment for me.</p> <p>I had a lovely lunch at Dad's on the 23rd, and he showed us his fancy new car!</p> <p>I was supposed to have a haircut yesterday, but because the weather was so foul I'm going into town to get one tomorrow instead. My hair has, once again, gotten to the point where it's just a bit too 'poofy' and so it's time to trim it down a bit.</p> <p>Today at PQA (a performing arts academy that myself and Catherine go to on Saturday mornings) I had my audition for the part of Oberon in our musical version of A Midsummer Night's Dream. I think it went okay, but the other lad who auditioned was also great, so we'll just have to wait and see.</p> <p>That's about all for now, but I'm sure my notebook will help me to keep track of some more vaguely interesting things to go on about in my next post. See ya!</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
