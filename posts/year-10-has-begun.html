Seriously, 7 weeks is not a long time when you're actually enjoying yourself.</p> <p>I haven't been writing any blog posts recently because I really didn't do much towards the end of the holidays.</p> <h4 id="my-first-week"><a href="#my-first-week" class="header-anchor">#</a> My first week</h4> <p>So I started in Year 10 on Wednesday, and I'm having a pretty good time so far! I've really enjoyed seeing my friends again, and I've just had a good time overall ðŸ˜„</p> <p>I've met most of my new teachers, and I can say they're all very nice! I'm taking triple science and so I have three separate teachers for each area (Biology, Chemistry and Physics). I basically have a science lesson every day (15 hours a week) which is a lot but then again, there's a lot to learn for GCSE.</p> <p>Overall I've had a very nice first week, and I'm looking forward to the rest of my time in Year 10!</p> <h4 id="high-school-musical-bvc-edition"><a href="#high-school-musical-bvc-edition" class="header-anchor">#</a> High School Musical: BVC Edition</h4> <p>I'm looking forward to the first school play rehearsal for High School Musical, which is on Tuesday. I still need to learn most of my lines but it's gonna be fine :p</p> <p>Expect to be hearing a lot more about High School Musical in the future!</p> <h4 id="the-somme"><a href="#the-somme" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Somme</h4> <p>Next Friday I've got a school trip to the Somme, which I'm really looking forward to. I've got to be at school at 4am though so that bit isn't as exciting, but France isn't exactly down the road!</p> <p>I'm definitely going to write about my Somme experience when I get back, so keep an eye out for that.</p> <h3 id="bye-for-now"><a href="#bye-for-now" class="header-anchor">#</a> Bye for now!</h3></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
